title: Why I Decided to Learn Coding
---

Coding was something that always interested me; it gives you the power to create things with very little resources.

 All you need is computer and maybe an internet connection, it does not even have to be a very powerful computer either, like game development which requires a powerful GPU to be able to render lighting etc. Coding opens up millions of doors; you can go into website development, program development and the future of artificial intelligence. It gives the common person the ability to add a tremendous amount of value to the world, without having to have a huge amount of capital. Before the revolution of the internet and personal computer, only the wealthy genuinely could create a massive amount of value to the world because in those times it was hard to do anything with wealth, but computers changed all of that. People like Elon Musk were able to take coding and build applications that are used by millions of people. I chose to learn to code because I wanted to bring value to the world, and I knew learning to code was the first step to reaching my goal, it gives me the opportunity to be able to reach people across borders, over oceans.
