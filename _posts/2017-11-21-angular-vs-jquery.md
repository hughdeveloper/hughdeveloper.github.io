Choosing a framework or library for a new project can be difficult. Bloc Jams Angular was a music website created with the use of Angular and/or JQuery, where people can listen to music streamed through the internet. This is what I learned.


#### Explanation

Bloc Jams was created to help better understand how to incorporate JavaScript into website development. In the end, I went with two different approaches that affected the project through the coding process, however, resulted in the same result.


#### Problem

The objective of this task was to understand how selecting different types of workflows can affect the outcome of a project as well as the amount of time an effort required to complete the project.


#### Solutions

I approached the project using two different workflows. The first version of Bloc Jams JQuery was created using JQuery, while the second version of Bloc Jams Angular was created using AngularJs and a light version of JQuery for creation functions. In both versions of the Bloc Jams, Angular and JQuery based versions all functionalities were the same, by keeping all the functions the same I was able to compare the time it took to code both projects as well as a good comparison on what issues I ran into using each workflow.


#### Results

Bloc Jams Angular was by far took the shortest amount of time to develop. The amount of code needed to develop the project was far less due to the Angular Framework which allowed me to be able to create different components that could be inputted into different pages without having to re-write the HTML code for it. However Angular also had some drawbacks, when it came to coding the JavaScript code I found that there were times that I would have to develop functions entirely from scratch or use a mix of my function development mixed with angular capabilities which JQuery already had. This ended up leading me to implement a light version of JQuery lit to be able to access some of their features.

When developing Bloc Jams JQuery JavaScript development was very easy due to all the tools (pre-developed functions) that were provided with JQuery. I found that there were lots of JQuery functions that I was able to incorporate into my development process. This gave me the ability to code fewer functions making my JavaScript files smaller in comparison. The only drawback with using JQuery is the load time. JQuery is a library of pre-made functions that we can call upon in our JavaScript file, so it is almost like loading two JavaScript files, one that holds all the JQuery functions and our JavaScript file that is for our application. Due to this, we are increasing the load time, which could be reduced if we used vanilla JavaScript. There are also two different ways you can incorporate JQuery into your application. The first is downloading the JQuery files and adding them to your files; this can be good because it gives you the ability to condense the JQuery file when you finish development by deleting the functions that you do not use. The second is to link the JQuery link to your application; this can be beneficially when your website does not have the fastest load time due to server latency if the link script to the JQuery file is faster. However, with that being said, there can also be issues if the link to the JQuery script has issues leading to problems with your website even though your servers may be perfectly fine.


#### Conclusion

Overall Angular and JQuery are both great applications that can be added to your project. Angular gives you a robust framework while JQuery is a library to use in your JavaScript coding. Angular is like a blueprint that you cannot go outside of; you can change the house colour, size and add rooms to it, however, the way you build the house needs to follow the blueprint.

JQuery is more like a bunch of prebuilt (think Legos), and you can use in your build, but it does not determine how you build the foundation and wall. When selecting a what type of framework or library to go with for your project you should figure out what your project is trying to accomplish and after knowing that do some research into the different types of frameworks and library to gain a better understanding of it. However, the most important thing to look at is your strengths. If you are an expert in Angular and have never used something like JQuery you should take into account the learning curve that you will have to go through if you decide to go with JQuery.


When it comes to choosing a framework/library, take your time looking at the efficiency of the code as well as the development time. Once you decide on one, it may be hard to change to another, later on, so keep the end game in mind with every decision you make.
